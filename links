C. A default Amazon VPC has a netmask of /20. It comes with an Internet gateway and a
route table refl ecting that Internet gateway. NAT and VPN can be added to the default VPC.


Every subnet in your VPC must be associated with exactly one route table at a time. However, the same route table can be associated with multiple subnets.

VPC peering network connectivity failures are typically the result of incorrect or missing route tables or firewall rules. VPCs in a peering connection must be able to communicate with each other as if they are within the same network to route traffic between them using private IP addresses.


Straight from AWS Sample Exam Questions:
An ecommerce company wants to lower costs on its nightly jobs that aggregate the current day's
sales and store the results in Amazon S3. The jobs run on multiple on-demand instances, and the jobs
take just under 2 hours to complete. The jobs can run at any time during the night. If the job fails for any
reason, it needs to be started from the beginning.
Which solution is the MOST cost-effective based on these requirements?
A) Purchase Reserved Instances.
B) Submit a request for a Spot block.
C) Submit a request for all Spot Instances.
D) Use a mixture of On-Demand and Spot Instances.

B â€“ The solution will take advantage of Spot pricing, but by using a Spot block instead of Spot Instances, the
company can be assured the job will not be interrupted.
