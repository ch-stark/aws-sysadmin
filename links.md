C. A default Amazon VPC has a netmask of /20. It comes with an Internet gateway and a
route table refl ecting that Internet gateway. NAT and VPN can be added to the default VPC.


Every subnet in your VPC must be associated with exactly one route table at a time. However, the same route table can be associated with multiple subnets.

VPC peering network connectivity failures are typically the result of incorrect or missing route tables or firewall rules. VPCs in a peering connection must be able to communicate with each other as if they are within the same network to route traffic between them using private IP addresses.
