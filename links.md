C. A default Amazon VPC has a netmask of /20. It comes with an Internet gateway and a
route table refl ecting that Internet gateway. NAT and VPN can be added to the default VPC.


Every subnet in your VPC must be associated with exactly one route table at a time. However, the same route table can be associated with multiple subnets.
